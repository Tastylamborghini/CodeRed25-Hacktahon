Hackathon for CodeRed Astra @ University of Houston

Our project was a AI assited Interior Design webapp

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project was built during October CodeRED Astra. Our team created an interior-design web application featuring an AI chatbot that interacts with users and suggests design ideas based on conversational input.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- Frontend: React and tailwind (handled by teammates)  
- Backend: Node.js/Express (my focus)  
- AI Integration: Google Gemini API (attempted)  
- Tools: API key management, environment variables, GitHub, deployment basics  

## ðŸ‘¥ My Role  
I focused on **backend development and AI-chatbot integration**:  
- Set up the backend architecture and learned API key authentication from Google workshops.  
- Attempted to connect the Gemini API to our chatbot so it could send and receive requests and responses dynamically.  
- Though I encountered roadblocks and teammates completed the AI integration, the hands-on backend experience sharpened my skills in server setup, API management, and collaborative problem-solving.
- My commits were mainly in the backend sections

## ðŸ“š What I Learned  
- Practical experience working with backend services and API key security.  
- Challenges in integrating advanced AI models into web applications.  
- How to pivot and support teammates when initial implementations face hurdles.  
- Improving team communication and aligning backend/frontend workflows during a hackathon.
 
Developed collaboratively with my hackathon team (see commits)
